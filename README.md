# HangMan-Game
It is a guessing game where a word is chosen from a text file consisting of 1000+ words. The player is allowed a certain number of incorrect guesses before they lose the game. For each incorrect guess, a part of a stick figure is drawn, representing a hanging man. The game continues until the guessing player correctly guesses the word.
